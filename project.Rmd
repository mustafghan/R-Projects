# Chapter 4: Basics of R 

## 4.2 Variables 

### 4.2.1 Variable Assignment
There are several ways of assigning variables in R. 
```{r}
x <- 2
y = 5
3 -> z
assign ("j", 4)
```
 You can do multiple assignments
```{r}
a <- b <- 7
```

### 4.2.2 Removing Variables

```{r}
rm(j) # This frees up memory in R
gc(a) # This frees up memory in the operating system. R does it automatically so you don't necessarily have to do this R does it for you already
```
